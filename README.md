Description: 
Our project is about building a model that tries to predict the difficulty (from A1 to C2) of a French written text.

Our approach:
First, we have tested the models presented in the guidlines. The logistic regression model proved to be the hughest performing one.
We then proceeded by applying some data augmenatation (stop words, ...) <Consequence (better/worse)>
Finally, we decided to go with a pretrained model called CamemBert found on huggingface, which finally gave us our best score.
